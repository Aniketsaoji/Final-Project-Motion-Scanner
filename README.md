4/3 
- good idea

4/11 
- I put your readme in docs.  While your README is more appropriate for a typcial project
since we have used READMEs for grades and communication in assignments so far, I would
like to do that for this project as well.  


## Data Documentation

look in the ./sql folder for all of the sql setup files

4/23 - Data Doc Grading

**********************
RUBRIC - For Data Documentation
CRITERIA:
Create SQL Complete for all tables. Table names and field names well
chosen, clearly presented.
COMMENTS:
- Security table is misnamed in the populate file
- Should security table  have date/time for motion data? I'm not sure what you are 
recording.  Is it motion sensors at a property at a particular time?
- Quotes table population is not complete
SCORE: 5 / 5 pts 
**********************
CRITERIA:
Populate SQL Complete - data is representative. All associations have
specific records demonstrating their relationships.
COMMENTS:
- you don't need to have a record of all mock data, but rather a representative quantity
of sample data, like a few accounts, specific renderings, some number of text messages.
sent.  Again, looking at security mockup, I'm not sure what you are recording.
SCORE: 5 / 5 pts 
**********************
CRITERIA:
All use cases documented with actor, pre/post conditions, queried and UI
mockup - there must be a sufficient number of use cases to receive full
credit. Five is the absolute minumum. Is the purpose and function of the
use case clear?
COMMENTS:
- Use case documentation is sparse.  See comments in your files.
- please update use case documentation and use case diagram so the names are 
exactly the same (i.e.  View Security System Status is not the same as View System Status)
- The number of and types of sensors are more relevant than square feet since
  that will dictate the amount of data you collect and store. 
- Reporting is thin, and there is no documentation for the text message use case.  
- History would be useful. Record incidents at a date time?
report.  For example, violation recorded at property, sensor, data/time.  Then a user 
could login and review armed sensor alerts issued in the past week (or whatever 
time period).  Same for admin.
At an absolute minimum you should log text messages sent.
- How exactly is the 3-d rendering created?  You list is as a pre-condition, but how
does a user create it?
- I could not find any ui mockup for the use cases.
SCORE: 5 / 30 pts 
**********************
CRITERIA
Is purpose and function of the project clear? Note this is only 5
points, but its really crucial.
COMMENTS:
-Yes purpose is clear.  Details still need work. 
SCORE: 5 / 5 pts 
**********************
CRITERIA: 
Data documentation includes a ER diagram.
COMMENTS:
Yes, there is an ER diagram.  However, data structure for the app needs adjustment and
additions.
SCORE: 5 / 5 pts

TOTAL SCORE: 25 out of 50
